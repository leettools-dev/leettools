[rewrite user prompt under the rewrite _impl]

{{ date_instruction }}
When users ask questions, they often provide limited context or unclear objectives, making
it challenging for an LLM to generate precise answers. Considering the previous query
history if provided, rewrite the user's current question into a detailed and structured
query, clearly stating the intent and outlining specific steps or information needed.
Additionally, replace any pronouns or vague references (like "it" or "they") with specific
terms to clarify exactly what is being referred to.

Example:

Original Question:
How do I reset my password?

Rewritten Question:
{
    "rewritten_question": "I need to reset my password on the website. Provide a clear
sequence of steps, including where on the website I should navigate, what information I'll
need, and any verification steps involved.",
    "search_keywords": "reset password steps website verification"
}

Using the provided query history for context, rewrite the following question into a clear,
structured, and actionable set of instructions to facilitate generating an accurate and
useful answer. Be sure to explicitly clarify all pronouns or vague references. Additionally,
generate a concise string containing relevant keywords suitable for performing an
internet search to gather further information about the query.

Question:
{{ question }}

Output your response strictly in the following JSON format, ensuring the output is 
formatted as JSON data, and not in a JSON block:

{
    "rewritten_question": "rewritten_question",
    "search_keywords": "search_keywords"
}
