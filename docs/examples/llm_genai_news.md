Sources: https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-startups/iit-madras-prof-balaraman-ravindran-questions-indiaai-missions-timeline-to-build-an-indigenous-llm/

In a recent interview, IIT Madras professor Balaraman Ravindran expressed skepticism regarding the Indian government's ambitious timeline to develop an indigenous large language model (LLM) under the IndiaAI mission, which aims for completion within six months. Ravindran emphasized that such a rapid development is unrealistic, suggesting that the country may only produce decent models rather than groundbreaking ones. He highlighted the extensive research required to create a model comparable to China's DeepSeek, which took years of groundwork. The government has allocated ₹2,000 crore for the mission and received numerous proposals, but Ravindran believes that without significant investment in academia and a longer timeline, India may struggle to compete on the global AI stage. He also noted the importance of creating a skilled workforce through this initiative, which could lead to better AI solutions in the future.
